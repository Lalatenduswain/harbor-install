## Prerequisites
To run `harbor-install.sh`, ensure the following:
- **Operating System**: Ubuntu (tested on Ubuntu 24.04 "Noble").
- **Sudo Permissions**: The script requires root privileges for installing packages and managing Docker containers. Run it as a user with `sudo` access.
- **Required Packages**: 
  - `curl` (for downloading Harbor installer).
  - `dpkg` (for package checks).
  - `ca-certificates` (for secure repository access).
  - Internet connection for downloading Docker and Harbor components.
- **Docker**: The script installs Docker CE if not present, but ensure no conflicting Docker installations (e.g., `docker.io`) exist.

## Installation
1. **Download the Script**:
   Clone or download the script from the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Lalatenduswain/harbor-install.sh.git
   cd harbor-install.sh
   ```
   Or manually save it as `harbor-install.sh`.

2. **Make it Executable**:
   ```bash
   chmod +x harbor-install.sh
   ```

3. **Run the Script**:
   ```bash
   ./harbor-install.sh
   ```
   - The script will install Docker, Docker Compose, download Harbor v2.9.0, configure it to run on `localhost:8989`, and start the Harbor services.

## Script Details
- **Name**: `harbor-install.sh`
- **Purpose**: Installs and configures Harbor, a container registry, with minimal user intervention.
- **Features**:
  - Checks for and installs Docker CE and Docker Compose if not present.
  - Removes conflicting packages (e.g., `docker.io`, standalone `containerd`).
  - Downloads and extracts Harbor v2.9.0 online installer.
  - Configures Harbor to run on `localhost:8989` with HTTP (no HTTPS).

**Note**: No end-user license agreement is specified for this script. If you wish to add one (e.g., MIT, GPL), please modify the script and README accordingly.

## Usage
- **Run the Script**: Execute `./harbor-install.sh` in the terminal.
- **Access Harbor**:
  - Once complete, open a browser and go to `http://localhost:8989`.
  - Log in with:
    - **Username**: `admin`
    - **Password**: `SuperSecretPassword`
- **Verify Installation**:
  ```bash
  docker ps
  curl http://localhost:8989
  ```
  - `docker ps` lists running Harbor containers (e.g., `nginx`, `harbor-core`).
  - `curl` should return the Harbor login page HTML.

**No Crontab Setup Required**: This script is designed for one-time installation, not periodic execution, so no cron scheduling is necessary.

## Testing and Setup
- **Test After Running**:
  - Check running containers: `docker ps`.
  - Test connectivity: `curl http://localhost:8989`.
  - Access the UI in a browser at `http://localhost:8989`.
- **Additional Setup**: None required beyond running the script, unless you want to:
  - Enable HTTPS by editing `harbor.yml` (uncomment and configure the `https` section).
  - Change the port or hostname (edit `harbor.yml` before `install.sh` runs).
